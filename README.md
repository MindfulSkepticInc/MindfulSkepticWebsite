## Mindful Skeptic

Is it possible to be a skeptic and truly change? **It is**, and we're on a beautifully weird mission to prove it. We believe:
- Change and healing is possible, **for everyone**.
- There are many paths, but ultimately **the change arises from within**.
- Knowledge and guidance on how to achieve that change should be **freely and openly accessible**.
- We may not all agree on everything, but **working together** and providing **clear and simple** education and helpful resources on the basics of healing is **something worth doing**.

Yes, that is all a bit aspirational. That's why we're starting small. Over the following months we'll be publishing video interviews of people who work in the healing arts and/or are on the path of change. Follow along [@MindfulSkepticOrg](https://www.instagram.com/MindfulSkepticOrg)
