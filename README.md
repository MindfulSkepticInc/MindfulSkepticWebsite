## Mindful Skeptic

Is it possible to be a skeptic and truly change? **It is**, and we're on a beautifully weird mission to prove it. We believe:
- Change and healing is possible, **for everyone**.
- Ultimately, the change arises from within, but knowledge and guidance on how to achieve it should be **freely and openly accessible**.
- We may not all agree on everything, but **working together** and providing **clear and simple** [ELI5](## "Explain Like I'm 5") education and helpful resources on the basics of healing is something worth doing.

Mindful Skeptic has some big and small projects planned. We're starting with video interviews of people who work in the healing arts and/or are on the path of change. Follow along [@MindfulSkepticInc](https://www.instagram.com/MindfulSkepticInc)
